Previously, Robot Software Engineer at <a href="https://polybot.eu">Polybot</a>, headed by [Dr. Wieland Brendel](https://is.mpg.de/~wbrendel). I have worked on distributed multi object tracking pipeline and diffusion-based policies deployed on the Spot robot. 

Before that, I was a PhD student at Embodied Vision group supervised by [Prof. Dr. Jörg Stückler](https://is.mpg.de/~jstueckler) at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de/), working at the intersection of Machine Learning and Vision-based robotics. Specifically vision-based object manipulation employing differentiable physics.
I also work on using differentiable rendering for unsupervised learning of scene’s physics, 6D rigid body pose estimation from images, methods for planning and control through contacts and frictional constraints with learned physics, and vision-based tactile sensing.

I did my M.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering at University of Siegen where I worked on robotics, optimization and computer vision.
I did my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Michael Möller](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/moeller-michael) at University of Siegen and 
[Prof. Dr. Jörg Stückler](https://is.mpg.de/~jstueckler) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent systems, Tübingen. 
I did my B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela.
